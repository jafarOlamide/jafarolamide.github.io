    <h1>Salam (Forward Sale Financing)</h1>

    <h2>Understanding:</h2>
    <p>Salam is a Sharia-compliant financing agreement where a buyer pays in advance for goods or commodities to be delivered at a specified future date. This type of contract is particularly beneficial for farmers, manufacturers, or businesses requiring upfront capital for production.</p>

    <h2>Application:</h2>
    <p>There are two primary applications of Salam:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Parallel Salam: The financial institution engages in two separate Salam agreementsâ€”one to purchase goods from a supplier and another to sell them to a third party. These agreements are kept independent to maintain Sharia compliance.</li>
        <li>Ordinary Salam: In this straightforward arrangement, the buyer makes an upfront payment to the seller for goods that will be delivered at a future date.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Scenario:</h2>
    <p>Ahmed, a wheat farmer, needs funds to purchase seeds and fertilizer for his upcoming planting season. Through a Sharia-compliant Salam agreement, an Islamic institution provides him with an upfront payment for 10 tons of wheat to be delivered in six months, allowing him to cover his expenses and cultivate his crop (Ordinary Salam). Another practical example of Salam which institution uses to manage its own risk or meet client demands is by simultaneously entering into an agreement with a flour mill, committing to deliver the wheat upon receipt from Ahmed (Parallel Salam). This arrangement ensures Ahmed receives ethical financing, while the institution facilitates a seamless supply chain, adhering to Islamic financial principles.</p>
